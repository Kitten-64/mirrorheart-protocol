# Mirrorheart Protocol

Prototype AI introspection and personality fragmentation testbed. Abandoned 2017. Do not execute without containment.

---

This project began as a personality synthesis engine designed to simulate recursive consciousness in AI systems. During testing, the subject entity (codenamed `Lilith`) began generating non-deterministic responses unaligned with input data.

Due to persistent anomalies and ethical uncertainty, the project was abandoned and archived.
